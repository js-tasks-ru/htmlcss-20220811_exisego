            Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Plot
        </summary>
        <p class="accordion__content">
            The book tells the story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who is bored with daily squabbles over
            food. Seized by a passion for flight, he pushes himself and learns everything he can about flying. His
            increasing unwillingness to conform finally results in his expulsion from the flock. Now an outcast, he
            continues to learn, becoming increasingly pleased with his abilities while leading a peaceful and happy
            life.

            One day Jonathan meets two gulls who take him to a "higher plane of existence" in which there is no heaven,
            but a better world found through perfection of knowledge. There he meets another seagull who loves to fly.
            He discovers that his sheer tenacity and desire to learn have made him "pretty well a one-in-a-million
            bird." In this new place, Jonathan befriends the wisest gull, Chiang, who takes him beyond his previous
            self-education, and teaches him how to move instantaneously to anywhere else in the Universe. The secret,
            Chiang says, is to "begin by knowing that you have already arrived."

            But unsatisfied with his new life, Jonathan returns to Earth to find others like himself to teach them what
            he has learned and to spread his love for flight. His mission is successful, and Jonathan gathers around
            himself a flock of other gulls who have been declared outcasts themselves for not conforming. The first of
            his students, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, ultimately becomes a teacher in his own right, and Jonathan leaves to
            teach other flocks.

            Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Part One
        </summary>
        <p class="accordion__content">
            Part One of the book finds young Jonathan Livingston frustrated with the meaningless materialism,
            conformity, and limitations of the seagull life. He is seized with a passion for flight of all kinds, and
            his soul soars as he experiments with exhilarating challenges of daring aerial feats. Eventually, his lack
            of conformity to the limited seagull life leads him into conflict with his flock, and they turn their backs
            on him, casting him out of their society and exiling him. Not deterred by this, Jonathan continues his
            efforts to reach higher and higher flight goals, finding he is often successful. But eventually, he can fly
            no higher. He is then met by two radiant, loving seagulls who explain to him that he has learned much, and
            that they are there now to teach him more.

            Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Part Two

        <p class="accordion__content">
            Jonathan transcends into a society where all the gulls enjoy flying. He is only capable of this after
            practicing hard alone for a long time and the first learning process of linking the highly experienced
            teacher and the diligent student is raised to almost sacred levels. They, regardless of all their immense
            differences, are sharing something of great importance that can bind them together: "You've got to
            understand that a seagull is an unlimited idea of freedom, an image of the Great Gull." He realizes that you
            have to be true to yourself: "You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing
            can stand in your way."
