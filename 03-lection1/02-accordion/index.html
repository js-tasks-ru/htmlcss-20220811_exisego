                The book tells the story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who is bored with daily squabbles
                over
                food. Seized by a passion for flight, he pushes himself and learns everything he can about flying. His
                increasing unwillingness to conform finally results in his expulsion from the flock. Now an outcast, he
                continues to learn, becoming increasingly pleased with his abilities while leading a peaceful and happy
                life.

                One day Jonathan meets two gulls who take him to a "higher plane of existence" in which there is no
                heaven,
                but a better world found through perfection of knowledge. There he meets another seagull who loves to
                fly.
                He discovers that his sheer tenacity and desire to learn have made him "pretty well a one-in-a-million
                bird." In this new place, Jonathan befriends the wisest gull, Chiang, who takes him beyond his previous
                self-education, and teaches him how to move instantaneously to anywhere else in the Universe. The
                secret,
                Chiang says, is to "begin by knowing that you have already arrived."

                But unsatisfied with his new life, Jonathan returns to Earth to find others like himself to teach them
                what
                he has learned and to spread his love for flight. His mission is successful, and Jonathan gathers around
                himself a flock of other gulls who have been declared outcasts themselves for not conforming. The first
                of
                his students, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, ultimately becomes a teacher in his own right, and Jonathan leaves
                to
                teach other flocks.

                Part One of the book finds young Jonathan Livingston frustrated with the meaningless materialism,
                conformity, and limitations of the seagull life. He is seized with a passion for flight of all kinds,
                and
                his soul soars as he experiments with exhilarating challenges of daring aerial feats. Eventually, his
                lack
                of conformity to the limited seagull life leads him into conflict with his flock, and they turn their
                backs
                on him, casting him out of their society and exiling him. Not deterred by this, Jonathan continues his
                efforts to reach higher and higher flight goals, finding he is often successful. But eventually, he can
                fly
                no higher. He is then met by two radiant, loving seagulls who explain to him that he has learned much,
                and
                that they are there now to teach him more.

                Jonathan transcends into a society where all the gulls enjoy flying. He is only capable of this after
                practicing hard alone for a long time and the first learning process of linking the highly experienced
                teacher and the diligent student is raised to almost sacred levels. They, regardless of all their
                immense
                differences, are sharing something of great importance that can bind them together: "You've got to
                understand that a seagull is an unlimited idea of freedom, an image of the Great Gull." He realizes that
                you
                have to be true to yourself: "You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and
                nothing
                can stand in your way."
